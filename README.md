This paper highlights the structure of each of the three alleles of the Danaus wing-pattern supergene

The commands cover:  
1. The polishing of the MB18102 MAT and PAT assemblies  
2. The repeat annotation of both MB18102 assemblies and both SB211 assemblies  
3. The annotation of these four assemblies. 
4. the filtering of gene alignments and production of gene trees for the full genome and each of the structural rearrangements  

Additional code for the production of TE landscapes (using a custom script GetTEBed) can be found [HERE](https://github.com/RishiDeKayne/GetTEBed)
